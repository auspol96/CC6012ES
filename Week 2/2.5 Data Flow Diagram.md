# Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Notation Guide

## 🧩 1. Overview

A **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** visually represents how data moves through a system — showing **processes**, **data flows**, **data stores**, and **external entities**.

It helps identify where data comes from, how it is processed, where it is stored, and where it goes.

## ⚙️ 2. DFD Symbols (Standard Notation)

| Element                                | Description                                                              | Typical Shape                                     | Example                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Process**                            | An activity or function that transforms input into output                | ⚪ **Circle** (or rounded rectangle)               | *Process Order*, *Validate Payment*   |
| **Data Flow**                          | Movement of data between elements                                        | ➡️ **Arrow**                                      | *Order Details → Validate Order*      |
| **Data Store**                         | Permanent or temporary data repository                                   | 🟦 **Open-ended rectangle** (two parallel lines)  | *Customer Database*, *Inventory File* |
| **External Entity / Agent**            | Person, organization, or system outside the scope that interacts with it | ⬜ **Rectangle**                                   | *Customer*, *Payment Gateway*         |
| **Information Store / Data Structure** | Logical representation of stored entities and attributes                 | 🗃️ Often same as Data Store in detailed diagrams | *Product (ProductID, Name, Price)*    |

## 🔄 3. Example: Simple Data Flow

### DFD for **Submit Order**

```
     +--------------------+
     |    CUSTOMER        |  (External Entity)
     +--------------------+
               |
               | Order Details
               v
          (1) ⚪ Receive Order       ← Process
               |
               | Validated Data
               v
          (2) ⚪ Save to Database    ← Process
               |
               v
      [== Order Database ==]        ← Data Store
```

## 🧠 4. Key Rules for DFD Design

1. **Each process must have both input and output**
   → Data cannot disappear or appear from nowhere.
2. **External entities** are always outside the system boundary.
   → They provide or receive data, but do not process it.
3. **Data stores** represent where data is kept permanently or temporarily.
   → They connect only to processes (not directly to external entities).
4. **Processes** are shown as **circles** or **rounded rectangles**.
   → Each process should represent one clear function.
5. **Data flows** use arrows to show direction of information movement.
   → The arrow label should name the data being transferred.

## 💡 5. Quick Visual Summary

| Symbol   | Meaning                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ⚪        | Process (transforms data)           |
| ➡️       | Data Flow (movement of information) |
| [==  ==] | Data Store (where data is kept)     |
| ⬜        | External Entity (outside actor)     |

---

### ✅ In Short

> **Processes** = Circles
> **Data Flows** = Arrows
> **Data Stores** = Two parallel lines `[== ==]`
> **External Entities** = Rectangles

Together, these make up a complete **Data Flow Diagram** that maps how information moves through a system.
