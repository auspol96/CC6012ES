# Levels of Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)

## 🧩 Overview

Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) can be drawn at multiple levels to show how data moves through a system — from a **broad overview** to **detailed internal processes**.

Each level provides a deeper understanding of how the system works.

---

## **Level 0 – Context Diagram**

* The **highest-level** and most abstract view of the system.
* Shows the **entire system as one single process** (Process 0).
* Displays **external entities** (people, organizations, systems) that interact with it.
* Only shows **major data flows** in and out of the system — no internal details.

🟢 *Think of it as the “bird’s-eye view” of the system.*

### Example:

```
[Customer] → (Process 0: Order System) → [Supplier]
```

* `Customer` and `Supplier` are external entities.
* `Order System` is the single main process.
* Data flows represent information exchanged (e.g. orders, confirmations).

---

## **Level 1 – Top-Level DFD**

* Expands **Process 0** into **main sub-processes** (usually 3–7).
* Shows **data stores** and **data flows** between them.
* Each process represents a **major system function**.

🟢 *This level explains how the main system functions internally.*

### Example:

```
(Customer) → (1.0 Receive Order) → (2.0 Validate Order) → [Order DB]
```

* Process 1.0 and 2.0 are top-level subprocesses.
* `[Order DB]` is a data store showing where the data is kept.

---

## **Level 2 (and Lower) – Detailed DFDs**

* Each **Level 1 process** can be broken down into **more detailed subprocesses**.
* Used to describe **specific tasks or logic** within each process.
* Continue decomposing until reaching **primitive processes** — the lowest level that cannot be broken down further.

🟢 *This level shows exactly how each process works step by step.*

### Example:

```
(2.0 Validate Order)
 ├── (2.1 Check Customer Credit)
 ├── (2.2 Verify Inventory)
 └── (2.3 Confirm Order)
```

* Each child process performs one specific task.

## 🧠 **Summary Table**

| Level  | Name             | Description                        | Focus                  |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **0**  | Context Diagram  | Whole system and external entities | System boundary        |
| **1**  | Top-Level DFD    | Main processes and data stores     | Major system functions |
| **2+** | Lower-Level DFDs | Detailed breakdown of subprocesses | Internal logic         |

## 💡 **When to Stop Decomposing**

Stop when each process performs a **single, well-defined activity** — this is called a **primitive process**.

### Example Hierarchy

```
Level 0: Process 0 – Order Management System
Level 1: 1.0 Receive Order, 2.0 Validate Order, 3.0 Ship Order
Level 2: 2.0 Validate Order → 2.1 Check Credit, 2.2 Verify Inventory
```

## ✅ **In Summary**

* **Level 0** → Big picture (system + external entities)
* **Level 1** → Main internal processes
* **Level 2+** → Detailed breakdowns until primitive processes

A good DFD allows anyone to understand **what happens**, **where data goes**, and **how information flows** throughout the system.
