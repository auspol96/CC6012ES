# 📘 Data Replication & Replicated Databases  

## 1. 🌍 What is Data Replication?
**Data replication** is the process of **copying data from one database site to another** so that multiple locations have a **local copy** of frequently used data.

### Why do we replicate data?
- Faster access for users at different locations  
- Reduces network load  
- Provides backup copies  
- Improves system availability  

**Simple explanation:**  
Replication = *copy the data so each site has its own local version.*

## 2. 📂 Replicated Database (Partial Replication)

A **replicated database** is a distributed database where **some** of the data is duplicated across selected sites — not all data is copied everywhere.

### Key characteristics:
- Selected tables or records are copied  
- Each site stores **only some replicated data**  
- Lower storage cost than full replication  
- Balances performance and storage  

**Example:**  
Only the "Sales" table is copied to two branches, but "Customer" data is kept only at HQ.

## 3. 📦 Fully Replicated Database (Full Replication)

A **fully replicated database** stores the **entire database** at **every site** in the distributed system.

### Key characteristics:
- Every site has a full copy  
- Maximum availability and read performance  
- Higher storage requirements  
- Updates must be synchronised across all sites  

**Example:**  
All branches of a company store:  
- Full Customer table  
- Full Sales table  
- Full Inventory table

## 4. 🗂 Comparison Table

| **Replicated Database** (some copies)                    | **Fully Replicated Database** (all copies everywhere) |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Only *parts* of the database are copied to certain sites | The *entire* database is copied to every site         |
| Some sites have certain tables/rows                      | Every site has the full database                      |
| Medium (not everything copied)                           | Very high (full copy everywhere)                      |
| Faster for copied data; slow for non-copied              | Very fast everywhere                                  |
| Medium–High (more copies = more syncing)                 | Highest (all sites must be updated)                   |
| Balancing speed and storage                              | Maximum speed + maximum availability                  |
| Sites store only what they need                          | Every site stores the full employee table             |

## 5. 🧪 Quick Quiz

1. Only the Inventory table is copied to each branch → **Replicated DB**  
2. Every site has the entire database → **Fully Replicated DB**  
3. Why is full replication expensive?  
   → Needs more storage & heavy synchronisation  
4. Which provides fastest read performance?  
   → Fully replicated DB

## 7. ✍ Exam‑Ready Short Answer

**Data replication:**  
The process of copying and maintaining data across multiple sites.

**Replicated database:**  
A distributed database where only some data is duplicated across selected sites.

**Fully replicated database:**
