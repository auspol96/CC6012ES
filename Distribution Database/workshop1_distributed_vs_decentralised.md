# 🧪 Workshop 1: Distributed vs Decentralised Databases  
### *Hands-On Architecture Design Workshop*

---

## 🎯 **Workshop Objective**
Enable students to clearly understand the differences between **Distributed Database Systems** and **Decentralised Database Systems** by designing real-world system architectures.

---

## 📘 **What Students Will Learn**
- How each architecture works in real business situations  
- How to analyse system requirements  
- How to design simple database distribution diagrams  
- How to justify database architecture choices  

---

# 🏁 Part 1 — Warm-Up (5 minutes)

### **Question for students:**
> “If you own 10 stores across Thailand, do you want all stores to share the same database? Or each store to run separately?”

Brief group discussion to prepare them for the workshop.

---

# 🧩 Part 2 — Group Activity (25 minutes)

Divide the class into **3–4 groups**.  
Each group will receive **four scenarios** (see below).  
Their task:

### ✔ Decide  
Whether the system should use:  
- **Distributed Database**, or  
- **Decentralised Database**

### ✔ Draw  
A simple architecture diagram with boxes and arrows.

### ✔ Explain  
Why they chose that architecture.

# 📦 The Four Scenarios

## **Scenario 1 — National Bank (200 Branches)**
- ATMs across the country  
- Customers must see the same account balance everywhere  
- Real-time updates required  

**Students must decide:**  
Distributed DB or Decentralised DB?

---

## **Scenario 2 — University with 4 Campuses**
- Student registration system must sync across campuses  
- Students move between faculties and campuses  
- Shared grades and student profiles  

**Decision needed.**

---

## **Scenario 3 — Chain of Restaurants**
- 15 branches  
- All use the same membership system  
- Orders can be viewed centrally  

**Decision needed.**

---

## **Scenario 4 — Independent Clinics**
- 6 clinics owned by different doctors  
- They do NOT want to share patient data  
- No network connection  

**Decision needed.**

---

# 📝 Deliverables (Your Group Must Produce)

Each group submits:

1. **Architecture type chosen**  
   - Distributed  
   - Decentralised  

2. **System diagram**  
   (simple boxes and arrows)

3. **Justification**  
   - Performance  
   - Data sharing needs  
   - Cost considerations  
   - Management complexity  

---

# 🎤 Part 3 — Group Presentation (10 minutes)

Each group presents for **2 minutes**, covering:
- Choice of architecture  
- Key reasons  
- Diagram explanation  

---

# 🏆 Part 4 — Instructor Summary

You will conclude by reinforcing:

### **Distributed DB → One database, many locations, connected**  
### **Decentralised DB → Many independent databases, not connected**

---

# 📚 Optional Extension

If time allows, groups can redesign one of the scenarios *incorrectly* (intentionally) and explain:

- What problems arise  
- Why the wrong architecture would fail  

This deepens understanding.

---

# ✔ End of Workshop 1
Students should now be confident in identifying and designing distributed vs decentralised database systems.
