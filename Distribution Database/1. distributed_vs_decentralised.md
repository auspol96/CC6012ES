# 📘 Distributed vs Decentralised Databases  
### *Lecture Summary for Students*

## 1. 🌍 Overview  
Students often confuse **distributed** and **decentralised** databases because both involve data stored in multiple places.  
The key difference is the **network connection** and **how the database behaves**.

## 2. 🧠 One-Sentence Memory Trick  
- **Distributed Database:** *One database, many locations, all connected.*  
- **Decentralised Database:** *Many independent databases, no connection.*

## 3. 🔍 Definitions

### **Distributed Database**  
A single logical database whose data is physically stored across multiple computer sites that are **connected by a communication network**.  
Users at different sites access data as if it were **one unified system**.

**Key characteristics:**
- Sites are connected (LAN/WAN/Internet)  
- Data can be shared across sites  
- Appears as one database  
- Central coordination or cooperative control  

---

### **Decentralised Database**  
A collection of separate databases stored at multiple sites that are **not connected** by any communication network.  
Each site operates **independently** with no automatic data sharing.

**Key characteristics:**
- Sites are NOT connected  
- Each location has its own standalone database  
- No automatic sharing  
- No central control

## 4. 🏪 Real-Life Examples

### **Distributed Database Examples**
- Bank ATM networks  
- Google Cloud Spanner  
- Multi-branch supermarket with shared inventory system  

### **Decentralised Database Examples**
- Independent clinics each using local software  
- Small shops with no shared POS system  
- Separate government agencies with isolated databases

## 5. 🗂 Comparison Table

| Feature | **Distributed DB** | **Decentralised DB** |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Network connection | ✔ Connected | ✘ Not connected |
| Data sharing | ✔ Yes | ✘ No |
| Logical database | Single | Multiple |
| Coordination | Central or cooperative | None |
| Data consistency | Can be synchronised | No automatic sync |
| Example | ATM network | Independent clinics |

### **Distributed Database**
```
       [DB Server A] <----- network -----> [DB Server B]
            |                                   |
       (same logical DB)                  (same logical DB)
```

### **Decentralised Database**

| Scenario | Distributed or Decentralised? |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| Starbucks stores share customer points in real-time | **** |
| Small bookstores operate independently | **** |
| University campuses using a single registration system | **** |
| Private accounting offices with separate systems | **** |

## 8. ✍ Sample Exam-Ready Answer

**Distributed database:**  
A single logical database stored across multiple sites connected by a communication network. Users at different locations can access the same shared data.

**Decentralised database:**  
A collection of independent databases stored at different sites that are not connected. Each site maintains and controls its own data without sharing.
