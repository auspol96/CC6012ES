# üìò Chapter 4: Working with Views in ASP.NET Core MVC

## üéØ Purpose
To help students understand how Views are used to render HTML responses and how Razor syntax can be used to embed C# into HTML.

---

## üìå Step-by-Step Guide

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Create a New ASP.NET Core MVC Project

#### Instructions:
1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Go to **File > New > Project**.
3. Choose **ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller)**.
4. Name it: `MvcViewsWorkshop`.
5. Choose the location (e.g., `D:\Workshop\MvcViewsWorkshop`).
6. Click **Next**.

#### Project Settings:
- Framework: **.NET 6.0 or later**
- Authentication: **None**
- Enable HTTPS: **Yes**
- Enable Docker: **No**

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Explore Existing View Files

Open `Views/Home/Index.cshtml`.

- This is a **Razor View**.
- Razor allows mixing C# with HTML using `@` syntax.

Example:
```html
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Today's date is: @DateTime.Now.ToShortDateString()</p>
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Modify the HomeController to Pass Data

Open `Controllers/HomeController.cs`:

```csharp
public IActionResult Index()
{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
    ViewBag.Note = "This is your first Razor View!";
    return View();
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Update the View to Use the Passed Data

Open `Views/Home/Index.cshtml`:

```html
<h2>@ViewData["Title"]</h2>
<p>@ViewBag.Note</p>
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Create a New View for a New Action

1. In `HomeController.cs`, add:
```csharp
public IActionResult About()
{
    return View();
}
```

2. Right-click on `Views/Home` ‚Üí Add ‚Üí New Item ‚Üí Razor View
3. Name it `About.cshtml`

Add content:
```html
<h2>About This App</h2>
<p>This page is served using a Razor View.</p>
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 6: Navigation Test

Run the app and try navigating to `/Home/About`.

You should see your custom Razor view.

---

## üß™ Hands-on Mini Challenge

- Add an action called `Contact` to `HomeController`.
- Create `Contact.cshtml` under `Views/Home/`.
- Display your name, email, and a fake address using Razor syntax.

---

## üìù Summary Notes

- Razor Views let you embed C# in HTML.
- Views are placed inside the `Views/{ControllerName}/` folder.
- Data can be passed using `ViewData` or `ViewBag`.

---

### ‚úÖ Outcome of This Chapter
Students will:
- Understand Razor syntax and how views are used
- Know how to pass and display data in views
- Be able to add and link new Razor views to controller actions
